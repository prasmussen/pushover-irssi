pushover-irssi
==============


## Overview
pushover-irssi is an extension to [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) which sends
push notifications through [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/) to your
android/ios device when you receive a private message or is highlighted in a
channel. Notifications will only be sent when you are idling.


### Idle detection
The extension listens for key presses inside irssi and you need to avoid
pressing any keys for 5 minutes (configurable) to become idle.
Any pm or highlight received in this 5 minute period will be queued up and
sent when you reach the idle state. Pm's and highlights received when you are
idle will be sent within a minute. There is a timer that checks each minute
if you are in the idle state and sends out any queued up notifications.


## Requirements
- Account at [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/)
- Pushover app installed on your mobile device
- LWP


## Installation

## Configuration

#### Create pushover app
At [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/) create a new application called

[pushover.net](https://pushover.net/).

#### Required irssi settings
- Load script `/script load pushover.pl`
